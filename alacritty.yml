  # Italic font face
  #italic:
    # Font family
    #
    # If the italic family is not specified, it will fall back to the
    # value specified for the normal font.
    #family: monospace

    # The `style` can be specified to pick a specific face.

  # Offset is the extra space around each character. `offset.y` can be thought
  # of as modifying the line spacing, and `offset.x` as modifying the letter
  # spacing.
  #offset:
  #  x: 0
  #  y: 0

  # Glyph offset determines the locations of the glyphs within their cells with
  # the default being at the bottom. Increasing `x` moves the glyph to the
  # right, increasing `y` moves the glyph upward.

  #  x: 0
  #  y: 0

  # Thin stroke font rendering (macOS only)

# Shell
#
# You can set `shell.program` to the path of your favorite shell, e.g.
